## Powered by PocketBase

[PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io) is a single-file backend written in Go and powered by SQLite. It can scale vertically and handle massive concurrency which makes it a great choice for most business applications. And because everything is open source, you can host your own instance of PocketBase on your own infrastructure.

## Why PocketHost?

PocketBase is very, very cool. But, to run and manage it successfully, you need to know a lot of backend Linux sysadmin/devops stuff:

- Probably Docker
- Email and DKIM+SPF and more
- DNS, MX, TXT, CNAME
- SSL
- Storage
- Volume mounts
- Could computing or VPS

That's where PocketHost comes in. Firebase and Supabase have made BaaS very attrictive, and PocketHost brings that same attractiveness to PocketBase.
